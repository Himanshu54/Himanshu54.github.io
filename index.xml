      <description>Simple c code to do a dns lookup.
#include &amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;sys/socket.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;netdb.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;netinet/in.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;arpa/inet.h&amp;gt; int main() { struct hostent *h = gethostbyname(&amp;#34;www.google.com&amp;#34;); printf(&amp;#34;%s\n&amp;#34;, inet_ntoa(*(struct in_addr *) h-&amp;gt;h_addr)); } This snippet was created to check wheather the underlying dns module was serving the same IP, overloading the server. Instead of google.com we obviously use an internal domain. The point being proved here is that, gethostbyname randomize which IP it will return.</description>

      <description>In my quest to learn vim, I stumbled upon a very excellent advise to disable arrow keys and force yourself to use only h,j,k,l movements. Being a former counter-strike enthusiast I know that this method works as I have forced me to learn better keybinds earlier too.
And since I am also looking into how to configure nvim properly whilest understanding what I put into my configurations, I decided not to blindly add vim-hardmode plugin.</description>
